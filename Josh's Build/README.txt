Custom Toon Shader: 

Started with the base toon shader we made in class. Using the knowledge gained from making other shaders I added in rim lighting (white colour) as well
as textures to the shader. The texture helps distinguish what an object actually is (a plain red mushroom model is dull and boring), and the rim lighting helps
distinguish the edge of a certain object from other objects/the environment/black outlines. I also worked on a custom ramp texture for the shader which has smaller/thinner
jumps between the larger ones (this adds a little more detail in the lighting I feel).

Colour grading/LUTs: 

Stuck close to the method of applying LUTs to the scene in-class, however to keep the red-ish tint to the mushroom across all LUTs (except the custom LUT) I added an
red overlay layer in photoshop. This keeps the red-tint of the mushroom while still applying warm/cool colours to the scene
